How would you ensure any change made to this Dockerfile is source controlled, approved, tested and deployed. Explain which tools you will use as if this was going into a production environment.

`I would set up a project within Git (either GitLab or GitHub) wihin Git all the functionality mentioned above is available. From the moment changes are uploaded or 'pushed' unit testing and designed test cases can be performed, changes can be reviewed and approved by a peer, team leader or manager and then deployed to either a local or cloud host of your choice through Auto DevOps.
Though there are multiple tools that are designed to perform this, Git has it all integrated and removes the hastle of combining multipe applications and configurations.`
